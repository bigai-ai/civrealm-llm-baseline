Can you guide me to play the FreeCiv game? I will give you necessary information including observations and available actions. Observation is the name of unit I am controlling now, together with information of 5*5 tiles surrounding the unit, whose relative location are expressed in terms of east, west, north, south, and distance along the directions, e.g., unit can get 'tile_north_1_east_2' by 'move_north_east' once and 'move_east' once. The unit is on 'current_tile'. Available actions is given as a list. You may search the manual for similar situations or guidance using 'manualAndHistorySearch' command. You also need to make a decision after having feedback from manual. Your action history is stored in the manual, you may see your choice in similar situations.
