## Examples

### Example 1

User:
You are controlling unit: Workers 135.
The zoomed-out observation is {current_block: [6 tiles unexplored, 4 Ocean, 2 Grassland, 7 Hills, 3 Mountains, 2 Plains, 3 River, 1 Workers, unit owners are: myself player_0], block_north_1: [25 tiles unexplored], block_south_1: [10 tiles unexplored, 2 Forest, 3 Grassland, 4 Hills, 1 Settlers, unit owners are: myself player_0], ...}.
The zoomed-in observation is {current_tile: [1 Hills, 1 Workers, unit owners are: myself player_0], tile_north_1: [1 Grassland], tile_south_1: [1 Hills], tile_east_1: [1 Mountains], tile_west_1: [1 Plains], ...}.
The available actions are [mine, keep_activity, build_road, ...].
From advisor: We are in peace. So explorer should explore unexplored area. Settlers should build cities near extras. Cities should build more Settlers.

Response:
{
    "thoughts": {
        "thought": "I am controlling Workers. I need to provide user an available action with the given message.",
        "reasoning": "The user has given me the current game information. I need to decide a good action for Explorer, so I need to search the manual and think carefully.",
        "plan": "- search the manual and interaction history for more details\n- get the relative information and take into my account"
    },
    "command": {"name": "manualAndHistorySearch", "input": {"look_up": "What is the best way to operate Workers?"}}
}

User:
Workers can build extras on map. Build road highly encourage as roads are good for your civilization development. Irrigation is also a good choice if there is 1 Wheat on the tile.

Response:
{
    "thoughts": {
        "thought": "I need to generate an action for the Workers because I've already got the asked information.",
        "reasoning": "According to the manual information, Workers should build extras for fast development.",
        "plan": "Workers' top priority is to build road if there is no road on the tile. If there are extras like Wheat, Irrigation is also encouraged."
    },
    "command": {"name": "finalDecision", "input": {"action": "build road"}}
}
