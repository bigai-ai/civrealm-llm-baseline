## Examples

### Example 1

User:
You are controlling unit: Explorer 136.
The zoomed-out observation is {current_block: [12 tiles unexplored, 2 Ocean, 3 Forest, 5 Grassland, 2 Plains, 1 Swamp, 4 River, 1 Explorer, unit owners are: myself player_0], block_north_1: [24 tiles unexplored, 1 Grassland], block_south_1: [25 tiles unexplored], ...}.
The zoomed-in observation is {current_tile: [1 Forest, 1 Explorer, unit owners are: myself player_0], tile_north_1: [1 Grassland], tile_south_1: [1 Swamp], tile_east_1: [1 Forest], tile_west_1: [1 Forest, 1 River], ...}.
The available actions are [fortify, goto_1, goto_2, goto_3, goto_4, goto_6, goto_7, hut_enter_0].
From advisor: We are in peace. So explorer should explore unexplored area. Settlers should build cities near extras. Cities should build more Settlers.

Response:
{
    "thoughts": {
        "thought": "I am controlling Explorer. I need to provide user an available action with the given message.",
        "reasoning": "The user has given me the current game information. I need to decide a good action for Explorer, so I need to search the manual and think carefully.",
        "plan": "- search the manual and interaction history for more details\n- get the relative information and take into my account"
    },
    "command": {"name": "manualAndHistorySearch", "input": {"look_up": "What is the best way to operate Explorer?"}}
}

User:
Explorer can explore the map. Order Explorer to explore unexplored areas on the map is highly encouraged.

Response:
{
    "thoughts": {
        "thought": "I need to generate an action for the Explorer because I've already got the asked information.",
        "reasoning": "According to the manual information, Explorer should try to explore the unexplored areas of the map.",
        "plan": "Explorer's top priority is to explored unexplored areas of the map. I should move Explorer to the most unexplored areas, like move South because block_south_1 has the most unexplored tiles."
    },
    "command": {"name": "finalDecision", "input": {"action": "move South"}}
}
