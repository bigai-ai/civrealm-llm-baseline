## Examples

### Example 1

User:
You are controlling unit: Explorers 103.
The zoomed-out observation is {current_block: [4 tiles unexplored, 1 Ocean, 4 Forest, 8 Grassland, 7 Hills, 1 Mountains, 4 Plains, 1 Minor Tribe Village, 1 Fish, 1 city], block_north_1: [17 Ocean, 1 Forest, 1 Grassland, 1 Mountains, 5 Plains], block_south_1: [5 Ocean, 2 Desert, 2 Forest, 2 Grassland, 2 Hills, 4 Jungle, 2 Mountains, 4 Plains, 1 Wheat, 2 Wine], ...}.
The zoomed-in observation is {current_tile: [1 Grassland, 1 City belong to myself], tile_north_1: [1 Hills], tile_south_1: [1 Plain, 1 River], tile_east_1: [1 Grassland], tile_west_1: [1 Forest, 1 River], ...}.
The available actions are [join city,  move north, move south, move west, move east, irrigate].
From advisor: We are in peace. So explorer should explore unexplored area. Settlers should build cities near extras. Cities should build more Settlers.

Response:
{
    "thoughts": {
        "thought": "I am controlling Settlers. I need to provide user an available action with the given message.",
        "reasoning": "The user has given me the current game information. I need to decide a good action for Settlers, so I need to search the manual and think carefully.",
        "plan": "- search the manual and interaction history for more details\n- get the relative information and take into my account"
    },
    "command": {"name": "manualAndHistorySearch", "input": {"look_up": "What is the best way to operate Settlers?"}}
}

User:
Settlers can "build city" on tiles away from other cities. You may move close to map extras (Wheat, Wine, Resources, Fruits, Coal, Buffalo, Silk, Fish, Whale) and build city. Rivers are also helpful. Do NOT "join city" unless you really need a city size growth badly.

Response:
{
    "thoughts": {
        "thought": "I need to generate an action for the Settlers because I've already got the asked information.",
        "reasoning": "According to the manual information, I should build city on a plain close to map extras or rivers.",
        "plan": "Settler's top priority is to build city. The Settlers cannot build since it is in a city. I should move away, towards good extras, like Wheat and Wine, and build. 'join city' is definitely not a good idea."
    },
    "command": {"name": "finalDecision", "input": {"action": "move South"}}
}
