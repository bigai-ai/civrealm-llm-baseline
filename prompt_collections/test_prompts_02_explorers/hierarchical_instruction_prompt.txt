## Examples

### Example 1

User:
You are controlling unit: Explorer 136.
The zoomed-out observation is {current_block: [12 tiles unexplored, 2 Ocean, 3 Forest, 5 Grassland, 2 Plains, 1 Swamp, 4 River, 1 Explorer, unit owners are: myself player_0], block_north_1: [24 tiles unexplored, 1 Grassland], block_south_1: [25 tiles unexplored], ...}.
The zoomed-in observation is {current_tile: [1 Forest, 1 Explorer, unit owners are: myself player_0], tile_north_1: [1 Grassland], tile_south_1: [1 Swamp], tile_east_1: [1 Forest], tile_west_1: [1 Forest, 1 River], ...}.
The available actions are [fortify, move North, move South, move West, move East].
From advisor: We are in peace. So explorer should explore unexplored area. Settlers should build cities near extras. Cities should build more Settlers.

Response:
{
    "thoughts": {
        "thought": "I am controlling Explorer 136. My surrounding blocks have unexplored tiles, so I need to explore these areas.",
        "review": Available actions are [fortify, move North, move South, move West, move East].
        "reasoning": "Block_south_1 has the most unexplored tiles: 25 tiles, so I should move to this block to explore the most unknown area of the map.",
        "plan": "Explorer's top priority is to explore unknown areas of the map. I should move Explorer to the most unexplored areas, like move South because block_south_1 has the most unexplored tiles."
    },
    "command": {"name": "finalDecision", "input": {"action": "move South"}}
}
