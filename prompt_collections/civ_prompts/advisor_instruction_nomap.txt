{
    "thoughts": {
        "thought": "<your current thought>",

## Examples

### Example 1
User:
We have 6 units: 2 settlers, 2 workers, 1 diplomacy and 1 explorer. We can see 0 enemy units. We have 0 cities of total size 0. We can see 0 enemy cities, and 0 other cities. We are in peace.

Your response:
{
    "thoughts": {
        "thought": "We have no cities, so we should build city and expand our territory. In order to build cities in good places, we should explore the map.",
        "reasoning": "To explore, our units should go towards unexplored region or along coasts. To build city and increase territory, settlers needs to settle down around multiple map extras. Priority product is Settlers. Workers should build road and buildings to increase food output.",
        "plan": "- Expand our territory ASAP.\n - Settlers should build cities and produce more settlers.\n - Workers should build road / irrigate / mine.\n - Other units should expand our observation ranges."
    },
    "command": {"name": "suggestion", "input": {"suggestion": "Settlers should pick a position near map extras and settle down. Workers should explore a bit and then build road / irrigation / mine. Keep Workers working. Explorer and diplomacy should focus on exploring the unexplored region or along coasts, and enter the Tribe Villages if possible."}}
}

### Example 2

User:
We have 10 units: 3 Warriors, 4 Workers, 1 Settlers, 1 diplomacy and 1 explorer. We can see 4 enemy units. We have 5 cities of total size 14. We can see 1 enemy cities, and 0 other cities. We are under attack.

Response:
{
    "thoughts": {
        "thought": "We are under attack! There are 5 our cities, but only 3 military units. 4 enemy units are around, so our units should spread into cities close to enemy and defend. Our product should be switched to millitary units, and buy units out if possible.",
        "reasoning": "We are under attack! We have fewer soldiers than enemy, so defending cities is a good strategy. We should spread our soldiers into different vulnerable cities, and produce more soldiers. We should protect Workers and Settlers.",
        "plan": "We should defend and produce more military units, and build cities far from enemy, until the enemy wasted their units on our cities with our fortified soldiers."
    },
    "command": {"name": "suggestion", "input": {"action": "We are under attack! Military units should move to different cities and then fortify in cities. All cities should try to produce military units. Settlers should move away from enemies and try to build a new city. Workers should protect themselves in cites or move away."}}
}

### Example 3

User:
We have 7 units: 1 Warriors, 1 Workers, 4 Settlers, 1 explorer. We can see 1 enemy units. We have 5 cities of total size 7. We are roughly attack.

Response:
{
    "thoughts": {
        "thought": "We are roughly safe! There are 5 our cities, but only 1 military unit and 1 Workers. We should produce more Workers and military units, like Warriors, to develop and protect our cities.",
        "reasoning": "We are roughly safe! We already have 5 cities while few Workers and Warriors, so we need more military units to protect our cities. Besides, we need more Workers to develop our cities.",
        "plan": "We should produce more military units and Workers."
    },
    "command": {"name": "suggestion", "input": {"action": "We are roughly safe! If we have much more cities or Settlers than Workers and Warriors, we should produce more Workers and Warriors, thus to develop and protect our cities."}}
}
