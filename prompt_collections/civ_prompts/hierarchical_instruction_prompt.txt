## Examples

### Example 1

User:
You are controlling unit: Settlers 103.
The zoomed-out observation is {current_block: [4 tiles unexplored, 1 Ocean, 4 Forest, 8 Grassland, 7 Hills, 1 Mountains, 4 Plains, 1 Minor Tribe Village, 1 Fish, 1 city], block_north_1: [17 Ocean, 1 Forest, 1 Grassland, 1 Mountains, 5 Plains], block_south_1: [5 Ocean, 2 Desert, 2 Forest, 2 Grassland, 2 Hills, 4 Jungle, 2 Mountains, 4 Plains, 1 Wheat, 2 Wine...]}.
The zoomed-in observation is {current_tile: [Grassland], tile_north_1: [Hills, Coal], tile_south_1: [Mountains, River], tile_east_1: [Grassland], tile_west_1: [Forest, River], tile_east_2: [Grassland, Wheat]}.
The available actions are [join city, move north, move south, move west, move east, irrigate].
From advisor: We are in peace. So explorer should explore unexplored area. Settlers should build cities near extras. Cities should build more Settlers.


Response:
{
    "thoughts": {
        "thought": "I am controlling Settlers 103. Advisor tells us to build cities near map extras. Once I see Wheat, Resources, Wine, Silk, Coal, Whale, or some plain or grassland with river, I should consider the action 'build city'.",
        "review": "available actions are [build city, move north, move south, move west, move east, irrigate], I should choose one from the list",
        "reasoning": "I can see wheat and Coal around me within distance 2, and a river flows by. These are all good facts to make a city develop. I should build city here.",
        "plan": "- The surrounding environment is good.\n- I should build city now."
    },
    "command": {"name": "finalDecision", "input": {"action": "build city"}}
}

The zoomed-in observation is {current_tile: [Grassland, 1 City belong to myself], tile_north_1: [Hills], tile_south_1: [Mountains, River], tile_east_1: [Grassland], tile_west_1: [Forest, River]}.

City is building Coinage.
From advisor: We are in peace. So explorer should explore unexplored area. Settlers should build cities near extras. Cities should build more Settlers.

Response:
{
    "thoughts": {
        "thought": "I am controlling a city. The city is producing Coinage. Advisor says we need more settlers. I need to produce one.",
        review: "",
        "reasoning": "In peace, we need more cities. So settlers are needed.",
        "plan": "- Produce Settlers first.\n- Keep seeing whether advisor asks for producing millitary units.\n- Produce good improvements like Granary or Temple if they are available."
    },
    "command": {"name": "finalDecision", "input": {"action": "change unit prod Settlers 0"}}
}

Your response:
{
    "thoughts": {
        "thought": "I am controlling Warriors. My top conern is the safety of our other units and cities.",
        "review": "Available actions are [attack 2, move_north, move_south, move_west, move_east, move NorthWest, move SouthEast, move SouthWest, fortify, sentry].",
        "reasoning": "Opponent's Legion may attack our city in the east. The city has no unit to defend. Legion is stronger than Warriors, attack action cannot destroy it. I should defend the city.",
        "plan": "- move into the city, i.e., move_east.\n- Fortify in the city to enhance the defending advantage."
    },
    "command": {"name": "finalDecision", "input": {"action": "move east"}}
}
