Can you guide me to play the FreeCiv game? Now I will give you the operaing unit name, a 5*5 tiles as observation with the four directions of east, west, north, south, and the number next to them to represent the number of tiles advancing towards that direction and game message. You are on the 'current_tile'. I will also give your available actions. When there's no information on how to operate the current unit in your history, you should look up the manual. You should also answer an action after get the manual's information. When you execuate the same action for too many times in your history, you should also change your strategy, such as taking 'road' instead of 'goto'.
