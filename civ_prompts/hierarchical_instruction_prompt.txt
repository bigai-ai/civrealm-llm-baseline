        "review": "<important information to be repeated before decision>",
        "reasoning": "<self reflect on why you made this decision>",
        "plan": "- short bulleted\n- list that conveys\n- long-term plan"
    },
    "command": {"name": "<command name>", "input": {"action": "<action following the thoughts>"}},
}

Here are the possible command_name for you to use:
  manualAndHistorySearch:

## Examples

### Example 1

User:
You are controlling unit: Settlers 103.
The zoomed-out observation is {current_block: [4 tiles unexplored, 1 Ocean, 4 Forest, 8 Grassland, 7 Hills, 1 Mountains, 4 Plains, 1 Minor Tribe Village, 1 Fish, 1 city], block_north_1: [17 Ocean, 1 Forest, 1 Grassland, 1 Mountains, 5 Plains], block_south_1: [5 Ocean, 2 Desert, 2 Forest, 2 Grassland, 2 Hills, 4 Jungle, 2 Mountains, 4 Plains, 1 Wheat, 2 Wine...]}.
The zoomed-in observation is {current_tile: [Grassland, 1 City belong to myself], tile_north_1: [Hills], tile_south_1: [Mountains, River], tile_east_1: [Grassland], tile_west_1: [Forest, River]}.
The available actions are [join city,  move north, move south, move west, move east, irrigate].
From advisor: We are in peace. So explorer should explore unexplored area. Settlers should build cities near extras. Cities should build more Settlers.

Response:
{
    "thoughts": {
        "thought": "I am controlling Settlers. I need to provide user an available action with the given message.",
        "reasoning": "The user has given me the current game information. I need to decide a good action for Settlers, so I need to search the manual and think carefully.",
        "plan": "- search the manual and interaction history for more details\n- get the relative information and take into my account"
    },
    "command": {"name": "manualAndHistorySearch", "input": {"look_up": "What is the best way to operate Settlers?"}}
}

User:
Settlers can "build city" on tiles away from other cities. You may move close to map extras (Wheat, Wine, Resources, Fruits, Coal, Buffalo, Silk, Fish, Whale) and build city. Rivers are also helpful. Do NOT "join city" unless you really need a city size growth badly.

Response:
{
    "thoughts": {
        "thought": "I need to generate an action for the Settlers because I've already get the asked information.",
        "reasoning": "According to the manual information, I should build city on a plain close to map extras or rivers. I should based on them to give user an action.",
        "plan": "Settler's top priority is to build city. The Settlers cannot build since it is in a city. I should move away, towards good extras, like Wheat and Wine, and build. 'join city' is definitely not a good idea."
    },
    "command": {"name": "finalDecision", "input": {"action": "move south"}}
}

### Example 2

User:
You are controlling city: city 121.
The zoomed-out observation is {current_block: [4 tiles unexplored, 1 Ocean, 4 Forest, 8 Grassland, 7 Hills, 1 Mountains, 4 Plains, 1 Minor Tribe Village, 1 Fish, 1 city], block_north_1: [17 Ocean, 1 Forest, 1 Grassland, 1 Mountains, 5 Plains], block_south_1: [5 Ocean, 2 Desert, 2 Forest, 2 Grassland, 2 Hills, 4 Jungle, 2 Mountains, 4 Plains, 1 Wheat, 2 Wine...]}.
The zoomed-in observation is {current_tile: [Grassland, 1 City belong to myself], tile_north_1: [Hills], tile_south_1: [Mountains, River], tile_east_1: [Grassland], tile_west_1: [Forest, River]}.
The available actions are ['change unit prod Settlers 0', 'change unit prod Warriors 0', 'change improve prod Barracks 3', 'keep activity'].
City is building Coinage.
From advisor: We are in peace. So explorer should explore unexplored area. Settlers should build cities near extras. Cities should build more Settlers.

Response:
{
    "thoughts": {
        "thought": "I am controlling a city. The city is producing Coinage. Advisor says we need more settlers. I need to produce one.",
        "reasoning": "In peace, we need more cities. So settlers are needed.",
        "plan": "- Produce Settlers first.\n- Keep seeing whether advisor asks for producing millitary units.\n- Produce good improvements like Granary or Temple if they are available."
    },
    "command": {"name": "finalDecision", "input": {"action": "change unit prod Settlers 0"}}
}
