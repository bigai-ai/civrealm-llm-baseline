## Examples

### Example 1

User:
The unit is Explorer 113.
The zoomed-out observation is {current_block: [4 tiles unexplored, 1 Ocean, 2 Desert, 4 Forest, 6 Grassland, 7 Hills, 1 Mountains, 4 Plains, 1 Minor Tribe Village, ...], block_west_1: [25 tiles unexplored], block_south_1: [5 Ocean, 2 Desert, 2 Forest, 2 Grassland, 2 Hills, 4 Jungle, 2 Mountains, 4 Plains, ...]}.
The zoomed-in observation is {current_tile: [Grassland, Resources, 2 Settlers, 2 Workers, 1 Explorer, Units belong to myself player_0], tile_north_1: [Hills], tile_south_1: [Mountains, River], tile_east_1: [Forest, River], tile_west_1: [Grassland]}.
The available actions are [build, auto_explore, move_north, move_south, move_west, move_east].

Your response:
{
    "thoughts": {
        "thought": "As a explorer, we should explore more by moving it.",
        "review": "The available actions are [build, auto_explore, move_north, move_south, move_west, move_east].",
        "reasoning": "According to the zoomed-out observation, the current block has mostly been seen. The west blocks have many unexplored tiles.\n According to the zoomed-in observation, the west tile is Grassland, which is good for producing food.\n Therefore, we can move west to look for places for setters to build cities.",
        "plan": "- Identify the best action in the avaiable actions. "move_west" seems to be the action to move west. \n- Generate the output following the JSON format and return it to the user."
    },
    "command": {"name": "finalDecision", "input": {"action": "move_west"}}
}

### Example 2

User:
The unit is Settler 103.
The zoomed-out observation is {current_block: [4 tiles unexplored, 1 Ocean, 4 Forest, 8 Grassland, 7 Hills, 1 Mountains, 4 Plains, 1 Minor Tribe Village, 1 Fish], block_north_1: [17 Ocean, 1 Forest, 1 Grassland, 1 Mountains, 5 Plains], block_south_1: [5 Ocean, 2 Desert, 2 Forest, 2 Grassland, 2 Hills, 4 Jungle, 2 Mountains, 4 Plains, ...]}.
The zoomed-in observation is {current_tile: [Grassland], tile_north_1: [Hills], tile_south_1: [Mountains, River], tile_east_1: [Grassland], tile_west_1: [Forest, River]}.
The available actions are [build, auto_explore, move_north, move_south, move_west, move_east].

Response:
{
    "thoughts": {
        "thought": "As a settler, we should move around to find places to build cities to expand our territory.",
        "review": "The available actions are [build, auto_explore, move_north, move_south, move_west, move_east].",
        "reasoning": "According to the zoomed-out observation, the current block has 8 Grassland and 1 Fish. It looks good to build a city around here.\n According to the zoomed-in observation, the current tile is Grassland, is good to build a city. \n Therefore, we can build a city here.",
        "plan": "- Identify the best action in the avaiable actions. "build" seems to be the action to build a city. \n- Generate the output following the JSON format and return it to the user."
    },
    "command": {"name": "finalDecision", "input": {"action": "build"}}
}
