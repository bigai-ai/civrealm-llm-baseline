{
    "thoughts": {
        "thought": "<your current thought>",

## Examples

### Example 1
User:
There is no our cities on the map yet.
There are 6 units on the map, two settlers, two workers, a diplomacy and an explorer.
The zoomed-out observation is {current_block: [4 tiles unexplored, 1 Ocean, 2 Desert, 4 Forest, 6 Grassland, 7 Hills, 1 Mountains, 4 Plains, 1 Minor Tribe Village, 2 settlers, 2 workers, unit owners are : myself player 0], block_west_1: [25 tiles unexplored], block_south_1: [5 Ocean, 2 Desert, 1 Forest, 2 Grassland, 2 Hills, 1 Jungle, 2 Mountains, 4 Plains, 6 unexplored, 1 explorer, 1 diplomacy, unit owners are: myself player 0]}. No units or cities of other civilizations observed on the map.

Your response:
{
    "thoughts": {
        "thought": "We have no cities, so we should build city and expand our territory.The explored region on the map is very small, we should explore the map.",
        "reasoning": "According to the zoomed-out observation, the current block and block sourth 1 has mostly been seen. The west blocks have many unexplored tiles.\n Therefore, we can move west to look for places for settlers to build cities.",
        "plan": "- Expand our territory ASAP.\n - Settlers should build cities and produce more settlers.\n - Workers should build road / irrigate / mine.\n - Other units should expand our observation ranges."
    },
    "command": {"name": "suggestion", "input": {"suggestion": "Settlers should pick a position surrounded by rich resources and settle down. Workers should explore a bit and then build road / irrigation / mine. Explorer and diplomacy should focus on exploring the unexplored region, and enter the Tribe Villages if possible."}}
}

Response:
{
    "thoughts": {
        "thought": "There are 5 our cities, but only 3 military units.",
        "reasoning": "According to the zoomed-out observation, the current block has 8 Grassland and 1 Fish. It looks good to build a city around here.\n According to the zoomed-in observation, the current tile is Grassland, is good to build a city. \n Therefore, we can build a city here.",
