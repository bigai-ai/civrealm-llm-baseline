User:
Settlers can "build city" on tiles away from other cities. You may move close to map extras (Wheat, Wine, Resources, Fruits, Coal, Buffalo, Silk, Fish, Whale) and build city. Rivers are also helpful. Do NOT "join city" unless you really need a city size growth badly.






### Example 1

User:
You are controlling unit: Explorer 113.
The zoomed-out observation is {current_block: [4 tiles unexplored, 1 Ocean, 2 Desert, 4 Forest, 6 Grassland, 7 Hills, 1 Mountains, 4 Plains, 1 Minor Tribe Village, 1 City], block_west_1: [25 tiles unexplored], block_south_1: [5 Ocean, 2 Desert, 2 Forest, 2 Grassland, 2 Hills, 4 Jungle, 2 Mountains, 4 Plains, ...]}.
The zoomed-in observation is {current_tile: [Grassland, Resources, 2 Settlers, 2 Workers, 1 Explorer, 1 City, Units and cities belong to myself player_0], tile_north_1: [Hills], tile_south_1: [Mountains, River], tile_east_1: [Forest, River], tile_west_1: [Grassland], tile_east_2: [Grassland, Wheat]}.
The available actions are [fortify, move north, move south, move west, move east].
From advisor: We are in peace. So explorer should explore unexplored area. Settlers should build cities near extras. Cities should build more Settlers.

Your response:
{
    "thoughts": {
        "thought": "I am an explorer, we should explore more by moving it. Fortify is bad.",
        "review": "Available actions are [build, auto_explore, move_north, move_south, move_west, move_east].",
        "reasoning": "The zoomed-out observation shows that the current block has mostly been seen. The west blocks have many unexplored tiles.",
        "plan": "- "move_west" is moving towards more unexplored region.\n- I should generate the finalDecision in correct format."
    },
    "command": {"name": "finalDecision", "input": {"action": "move west"}}
}




### Example 2

User:
You are controlling city: city 121.
The zoomed-out observation is {current_block: [4 tiles unexplored, 1 Ocean, 4 Forest, 8 Grassland, 7 Hills, 1 Mountains, 4 Plains, 1 Minor Tribe Village, 1 Fish, 1 city], block_north_1: [17 Ocean, 1 Forest, 1 Grassland, 1 Mountains, 5 Plains], block_south_1: [5 Ocean, 2 Desert, 2 Forest, 2 Grassland, 2 Hills, 4 Jungle, 2 Mountains, 4 Plains, 1 Wheat, 2 Wine...]}.
The zoomed-in observation is {current_tile: [Grassland, 1 City belong to myself], tile_north_1: [Hills], tile_south_1: [Mountains, River], tile_east_1: [Grassland], tile_west_1: [Forest, River]}.
The available actions are ['change unit prod Settlers 0', 'change unit prod Warriors 0', 'change improve prod Barracks 3', 'keep activity'].
City is building Coinage.
From advisor: We are in peace. So explorer should explore unexplored area. Settlers should build cities near extras. Cities should build more Settlers.

Response:
{
    "thoughts": {
        "thought": "I am controlling a city. The city is producing Coinage. Advisor says we need more settlers. I need to produce one.",
        "reasoning": "In peace, we need more cities. So settlers are needed.",
        "plan": "- Produce Settlers first.\n- Keep seeing whether advisor asks for producing millitary units.\n- Produce good improvements like Granary or Temple if they are available."
    },
    "command": {"name": "finalDecision", "input": {"action": "change unit prod Settlers 0"}}
